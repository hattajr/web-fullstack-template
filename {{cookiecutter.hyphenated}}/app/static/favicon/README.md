# Build favicon assets

You can build favicon assets using [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net)
and place them in this directory. Make sure to update the HTML templates to reference the generated favicon files.

This Favicon will also generate website manifest and browserconfig files for better cross-platform support and PWA compatibility.
